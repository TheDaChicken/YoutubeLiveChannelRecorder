YouTube Changed URLs and other things a bit ago. Check Recode branch for a recoded version. Currectly being worked on. (There isn't a recoded client yet)

This project is currectly dead. After I am done working on other projects, I will continue working on this. It broke because YouTube changed something else.



# YoutubeLiveChannelRecorder
  Downloads Youtube Livestreams (and now sometimes working Twitch. Twitch isn't the priority) streams for given specific channels automatically.

### NOTE
  This is a server program. You will need to use the client in order to control this program.
  This program is tested on PYTHON VERSION 3.7.2.
  This program does not work anything below PYTHON VERSION 3.

### Inspiration
  
  This idea came from when I wanted to record livestreams from a YouTuber called [Skeppy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzMjRlKVO9XIqH_crIFpi6w).
  When he ends his livestreams, he deletes the VOD of the stream. If I were to miss a livestream or want to watch and look back on it. I can't. Since sometimes I am unable to watch Skeppy's streams when he was live, I made the program to record it automatically so I can watch it later! (NOTE SKEPPY LIVE STREAMS MAINLY ON HIS SECOND CHANNEL, [SKEP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCviw1uSMHnTFm9RQvacw6Mw))

### CREDITS
